# CVE_Assessment_03_2018
Two solutions were verified in this assessment: 1) the Asset Manager (Enterprise Edition) and 2) the Training Manager (Enterprise Edition). The first is used to control and monitor fixed assets such as computers and equipment. The second is used to track employee training records.

Both software presented some vulnerabilities including remote access and persistence. The main causes of those vulnerabilities were related to specific files such as: “isxdl.dll”, “996E.temp”, “profinder.vshost.exe”, “AssetManager.exe” and “TrainingManager.exe”.

Currently, there are several documented techniques that could be used to exploit those vulnerabilities.
